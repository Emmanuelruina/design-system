      For the rare case that the seal is on a material not being printed in full
      color, the one-color seal in black should be used. The one-color seal
      should always be placed on a white background.
    variation_name: One-color seal
usage: >-
  Use of the seal is very limited. It should never be used on consumer-facing
  materials, as it is important that the CFPB logo is consistently used to help
  consumers recognize and trust the CFPB.  


  The seal is used on a limited set of materials regarding enforcement,
  governmental affairs and official items from the Director’s office. These
  materials are limited to: 


  * Official correspondence from the Director

  * Event materials where the Director’s office is the primary participant
  (e.g., podium placards and signage) 

  * Statutorily required reports  

  * Examiner commissioning certificates 

  * Legal actions 

  * Office of Administrative Adjudication official documents 

  * PIV cards 

  * Bureau flag 

  * Employee awards, commendations, and certificates from the Director 

  * Delegations of Authority from the Director
restrictions:
  - restrictions_do: >-
      * Use the seal at its benchmark size of 1.75” for most materials, such as
      a report cover. For materials such as signage and flags where the seal
      needs to appear larger, increase the seal's size in increments of 0.5”.  

      * Use ample space around the seal to ensure maximum impact and keep the
      mark from looking cluttered. The clear space on each side of the seal
      should be ¼” of the seal’s size.  

      * Place the seal on a white background. The only other color the seal may
      be placed on is navy, and this is reserved for select cases, such as CFPB'
      flag.
    restrictions_do_not: >-
      * Don’t stretch or condense the seal. This weakens the brand.  

      * Don’t alter the text of the seal in any way. 

      * Don’t remove design or text elements from the seal.  

      * Don’t apply a drop shadow. 

      * Don’t outline the seal or change its colors. 

      * Don’t rotate the seal. This impairs readability. 

      * Don't place the seal on a background that is a pattern, photo, or color
      other than white or navy.
