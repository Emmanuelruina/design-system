      For the rare case that the seal is on a material not being printed in full
      color, the one-color seal in black should be used. The one-color seal
      should always be placed on a white background.

usage: >-
  Use of the seal is very limited. It should never be used on consumer-facing
  materials, as it is important that the CFPB logo is consistently used to help
  consumers recognize and trust the CFPB.  


  The seal is used on a limited set of materials regarding enforcement,
  governmental affairs and official items from the Director’s office. These
  materials are limited to: 


  * Official correspondence from the Director

  * Event materials where the Director’s office is the primary participant
  (e.g., podium placards and signage) 

  * Statutorily required reports  

  * Examiner commissioning certificates 

  * Legal actions 

  * Office of Administrative Adjudication official documents 

  * PIV cards 

  * Bureau flag 

  * Employee awards, commendations, and certificates from the Director 

  * Delegations of Authority from the Director
