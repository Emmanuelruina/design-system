status: Proposed
description: The story page template is highly visual, using full-bleed images
  and scaled-up headings (H2s) to tell a story with emotional impact. Use of
  this template should generally be reserved for high-profile initiatives. An
  example of a story page is the [racial equity
  page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/racial-equity).

use_cases: >-
  When to use


  * You want to tell a story or make a statement; and 

  * You want the story or statement to have emotional impact that will be enhanced with the use of full-bleed images and large headings; and

  * The page is intended to be fairly high-profile (e.g. a director's priority page)


  When not to use


  * You want to quickly direct readers to specific content on a given topic. Use the sublanding or browse pages instead. 

  * The content is informational and text-heavy, such as an article or blog post. Use the learn page instead.  
guidelines: >
  ### Content guidelines

  The hero area should contain an H1, without any additional introductory subcopy.

  * 41 characters max (one-line heading)

  * 82 characters max (two-line heading)


  H2:

  * Headings should form the narrative backbone of the page - when read together, they should tell a story. 
behavior: Full-bleed images will shrink to fit as the viewport is resized.
