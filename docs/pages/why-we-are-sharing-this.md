The CFPB strives to better serve consumers by using plain language; relying on simple, user-friendly design; and providing easy access to information that can help consumers make informed decisions.

This Design Manual is an open-source resource for CFPB staff to produce effective and visually-consistent products that are easy for consumers to access, use, and understand. The Manual includes our design principles, guidelines for user experience, visual identity standards, and code snippets for common user interface elements. The Manual will continue to evolve as we learn what works best for the CFPB and the people we serve.

Capital Framework is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with the following goals: consolidate front-end code patterns across CFPB web products in a collaborative way, adhere to design and UX standards set forth by the CFPB Design Manual, respect the guiding principles of accessibility, and support a wide range of browsers.

As a work of the United States government, all code is open source and in the public domain (excluding any exceptions listed within in the projectâ€™s TERMS.md file). We encourage you to use this framework in your own projects and to contribute back.

#### Browser support & testing
We actively test Capital Framework components in the following browsers:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Edge
* IE 8+
* Safari on iOS
* Chrome for Android

#### Accessibility
We deeply value accessible web products and work to ensure that all of our components comply with Section 508 rules for creating accessible software and websites. We actively test components to ensure that they are keyboard and screen reader friendly.

#### A NOTE ABOUT OUR STANDARDS
These standards reflect our latest thinking and are just beginning to be incorporated into the CFPB's most recent projects. See these standards in practice in eRegs, Consumer Response, and HMDA.
