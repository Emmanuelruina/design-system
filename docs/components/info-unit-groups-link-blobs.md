      The half-width link blob is used on higher-level template pages to provide
      succinct descriptions and lead users to content deeper within the section.
      The two-column layout utilizes extra screen real estate found at higher
      breakpoints.

      ##### When to use


      * Default option for providing succinct descriptions and navigation paths
      to child pages from a parent page.

      * Ideally, when an even number of these components can be featured
      together.


      ##### When other options are better


      * When the number of components would be better featured in multiples of
      3. Suggest using third-width link blob.

      * When content requires imagery. Suggest using the 50/50 image and text or
      25/75 image and text components instead.

      * When there are multiple paragraphs of copy

      * When we are not implying a parent/child relationship between the current
      page and the linked page

      The third-width link blob provides users with supplemental content or
