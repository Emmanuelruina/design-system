intro: >-
  Icons visually reinforce an interface action, file type, status, or category.


  They are visually simple, quickly recognizable, and easy to understand. They
  are almost always used in context with descriptive text and function to
  reinforce the message of that text.

  #### Content guidelines


  ##### Color


  Icons should always be one color. If used over a color field, negative space
  should be knocked out.


  Although color usage is flexible, icons should always be used in high contrast
  tones relative to the background to maximize legibility.

  example](/design-system/images/uploads/minicons3a_-2.png)


  ##### Spacing


  Padding varies around icons of various primary shapes. Square, vertically and
  horizontally rectangular, diagonal, and most complex icons can fit within the
  relative padding bounding box. Circular and some complex icons should be
  slightly larger to offset the visual weight of surrounding negative space.

  spacing diagram")


  ##### Animation


  In certain instances, icons can be animated to aid communication or to
  reassure the user that an action is functioning as intended. Examples include
  saving or loading content. Depending on the context, the animated icon follows
  the standards of the component that contains it, for example, the icon follows
  the size and padding standards for buttons when placed inside a button to
  indicate loading or follows standards of a form-level alert within an alert
  message.
