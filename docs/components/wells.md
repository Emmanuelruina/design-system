usage: "#### Use cases\n\nUse sparingly to attract usersâ€™ attention to a concise piece of content. Ideally, content within a well should not take up more than a third of page content.\n\nFull width text, images, and embedded media (like video) may be placed within wells, however, if content includes imagery also consider the featured content module.\n\n#### Content guidelines\n\n* Grey wells should be used to feature content or specific calls to action; text should be succinct.\n* Grey well will help visually set apart the content within it, so use it to draw attention to that content.\n* Grey wells should take up less than a third of a page.\n* Currently, single column content only.\n* Types of atoms you can place in a well include:\n  * Headings (H2 - H5)\n  * Text (including bullets and numbered lists)\r\n  * Links\n* Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces).\n\n#### Behavior\n\n##### Breakpoints 900+\n\nPage with a right sidebar\n\n![](/design-system/images/uploads/wells_behavior_mockup_1.png)\n\nBrowse page with left nav\n\n![](/design-system/images/uploads/wells_behavior_mockup_2.png)\n\n##### Breakpoints 900 and under\n\nWells are full width.
