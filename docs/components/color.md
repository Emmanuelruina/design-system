  authority and expertise in communication.

      Our core brand color is CFPB Green. Green 60 and Green 20 play a
      supporting role in basic branded pieces. Black is typically used for type
      and icons while grays are used for wells and accents, such as rules and
      borders.

      The secondary color palette introduces visual variety. Colors were
      selected to hold together as a family and coordinate with CFPB Green.

      Tints expand upon the primary and secondary color palettes to help create
      visual cohesion when incorporating complex illustrations and data
      visualizations.

  To update the color palette within the Design Manual:


  1. Update the values within the CFPB Brand Colors CSV file

  2. From terminal within this repo run npm run colors, this will auto-generate
  a new brand-palette.less file

  3. Run grunt build (you may need the -f flag because of linting issues)

  4. Run npm start and check
  /design-manual/brand-guidelines/color-principles.html locally

  5. Commit the changes and open a PR.


  Once the PR is merged, the Less file needs to be duplicated in Capital
  Framework CF Core and follow that projectâ€™s release process.
