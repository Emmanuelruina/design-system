  <p style="padding-bottom:20px">The mega menu groups related links in a
  compact, easy-to-access fashion for both desktop and mobile breakpoints. Our
  mega menu is divided into five main sections: Consumer Tools, Practitioner
  Resources, Data and Research, Policy and Compliance, and About Us.</p>

  <h2 style="padding-top:20px"> Design principles</h2>


  **The mega menu works everywhere.** Our mega menu is based on industry
  standards around web development and user expectations around interactions.
  The mega menu works:


  * across our supported browsers,

  * across different browser sizes (and not just device form factors),

  * across the spectrum of user ability levels or technology familiarity, and

  * in line with the standard interactions for different assistive techniques.


  **It’s equitable for all.** Our mega menu is designed to provide full
  navigational support to all users. This includes users with physical
  disabilities, hearing and visual impairments, mental disorders, cognitive
  disabilities, or seizure disorders. Our mega menu is accessible and usable by
  all who use assistive technologies regardless of what type of disability they
  might have or their percentage within our larger user base. We do not ignore
  the needs of the few to only focus on the many.


  **It’s standardized.** Our mega menu fully aligns with the WCAG core
  accessibility principles known as POUR: every part of it is perceivable,
  operable, understandable, and robust for all users.


  **It’s focused on navigation and content.** Our mega menu is built
  mobile-first with semantic code to focus on the content and navigation
  elements within it. It’s designed to work with the interaction defaults of
  both JAWS and Apple VoiceOver. The visual design supports all of these factors
  and doesn’t supersede them.


  **It’s a good and ever-improving experience.** We maintain a good mega menu
  experience for our users and actively work to improve it. All the designers
  and developers in the department read, share, and know where to find basic
  information about the mega menu. We are aware of its guidelines, its
  complexities, and what traps to avoid falling into when modifying it. We
  monitor and publish our site analytics for the mega menu on a regular basis to
  make sure that we’re continually aware of how users are using it and able to
  make necessary adjustments over time as needed. We also usability test the
  mega menu with external users as a part of the monitoring process.
