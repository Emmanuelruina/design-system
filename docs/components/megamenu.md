  ## Summary of [consumerfinance.gov](https://www.consumerfinance.gov) mega menu
  design principles


  1. The mega menu works everywhere.

  2. It’s equitable for all.

  3. It’s standardized.

  4. It’s focused on navigation and content.

  5. It’s a good and ever-improving experience.


  ## More detailed version of design principles


  1. Our mega menu is based on industry standards around web development and
  user expectations around interactions. The mega menu works:


  * across our supported browsers,

  * across different browser sizes (and not just device form factors),

  * across the spectrum of user ability levels or technology familiarity, and

  * in line with the standard interactions for different assistive techniques.


  2. Our mega menu is designed to be equitable and provides full navigational
  support to all users. This includes users with physical disabilities, hearing
  and visual impairments, mental disorders, cognitive disabilities, or seizure
  disorders. Our mega menu is accessible and usable by all who use assistive
  technologies regardless of what type of disability they might have or their
  percentage within our larger user base. We do not ignore the needs of the few
  to only focus on the many.

  3. Our mega menu fully aligns with the WCAG core accessibility principles
  known as POUR: every part of it is perceivable, operable, understandable, and
  robust for all users.

  4. Our mega menu is built mobile-first with semantic code to focus on the
  content and navigation elements within it. It’s designed to work with the
  interaction defaults of both JAWS and Apple VoiceOver. The visual design
  supports all of these factors and doesn’t supersede them.

  5. We maintain a good mega menu experience for our users and actively work to
  improve it. All the designers and developers in the department read, share,
  and know where to find basic information about the mega menu. We are aware of
  its guidelines, its complexities, and what traps to avoid falling into when
  modifying it. We monitor and publish our site analytics for the mega menu on a
  regular basis to make sure that we’re continually aware of how users are using
  it and able to make necessary adjustments over time as needed. We also
  usability test the mega menu with external users as a part of the monitoring
  process.


  The consumerfinance.gov website mega menu is composed of five verticals:
  Consumer Tools, Practitioner Resources, Data & Research, Policy & Compliance,
  and About Us. **The visual layout, spacing, and some portion of the content
  guidelines will change in the near future, as we monitor analytics
  information.**
