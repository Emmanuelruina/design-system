  Buttons signal actions. They should be used sparingly; each additional button
  on a page reduces the visual prominence of a call to action. In contrast,
  [links](https://consumerfinance.gov) should lead users to another page or
  further information.
variations: |
  There are many types of buttons. Here they are.

  #### Default state

usage: >-
  **Use cases**


  Use primary buttons for actions that go to the next step. Use secondary
  buttons for actions that happen on the current page. Generous white space
  lends focus and makes buttons more actionable. Avoid using multiple primary
  buttons on a single page; there can be multiple secondary buttons per page.


  Use an animated icon in a button to reassure the user that the action they are
  attempting to perform is functioning as intended.


  **Content guidelines**


  Labels should be written in sentence case. Use verbs and an active voice.
  Language should be clear, succinct, and informative. Limit the copy length to
  22 characters.


  Use icons consistently. Each icon should be used exclusively for one action.
  Icons appear to the left of the button text. Buttons that have “forward”
  actions have icons to the right of the text, and those with “back” actions
  have icons to the left.
accessibility: It's important that buttons are accessible. Here's how to ensure that.
research: We studied buttons for a long time.
