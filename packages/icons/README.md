Design System icons

This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Design System,
a front end framework developed at the
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://consumerfinance.gov).

## How to use this component

Detailed instructions can be found at the Design System
[documentation site](https://cfpb.github.io/design-system/).

> NOTE: Be sure to run the Less files through
  [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer),
  or your compiled Design System CSS will not work
  perfectly in older browsers.
