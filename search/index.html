            'title': 'Accessibility principles',
            'description': "The following four principles, as defined by the W3C®, lay the foundation for ensuring that web content is available for all users, including users with disabilities and users on non-desktop devices. They also enable future compatibility in the event that future devices are radically different from those in use today.\n\n\n  Perceivable\n  Operable\n  Understandable\n  Robust\n\n\nNote: While this document can function as a checklist – and at times, it will – that isn’t the primary purpose. The goal is to foster understanding of why these guidelines are important.\n\nThis guide is adapted from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, a W3C Recommendation. More info.\n\nPerceivable\n\n(View on W3C site)\n\nInformation and user interface elements must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. This includes considering individuals using assistive technology (e.g., screen readers for blind users or captions for deaf users) and the limitations of different devices (e.g., grayscale screens or muted mobile devices).\n\nInclude text alternatives for non-text content\n\nFor any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations, charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is text-based.\n\n\n  Use the alt and title attributes on images and other graphical elements.\n  Use the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;desc&gt; elements in SVG drawings.\n  Use fallback text for the &lt;object&gt; element.\n  Include descriptive text near images (for example, a pie chart legend with percentages of each item).\n  Provide transcripts of audio and video recordings.\n  Provide alternatives for multimedia\n  Multimedia such as audio, video, and animations will usually require more than just descriptive text. In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.\n\n\nPrerecorded content\n\n\n  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.\n  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.\n  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).\n\n\nLive content\n\n\n  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.\n\n\nOrganize content semantically\n\nSemantic content allows user agents to correctly parse documents and present it to end users in a way that is appropriate for their device and medium without losing information or structure.\n\n\n  Use semantic HTML, including relative header tags, lists, and semantic tags like &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;figure&gt;\n  Support HTML tables with semantic tags like &lt;th&gt;, &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, and &lt;caption&gt;\n  Mark up HTML forms with semantic tags like &lt;label&gt;, &lt;fieldset&gt;, &lt;legend&gt;, and – where appropriate – HTML5 form additions like email fields.\n  If the sequence of a page matters, the underlying HTML document should be in that order or the sequence should be machine-readable through another method.\n  Avoid text descriptions that rely on layout or other sensory items such as “click the round button” or “the image on the right.” However, note that “above” and “below” are generally understood to mean “preceding” and “after,” and as such are permissible usage.\n\n\nMake content easily distinguishable from its surroundings\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.\n\nText\n\n\n  Choose easy-to-read fonts.\n  Avoid using images of text, except for logos and images meant to represent physical documents.\n  Text should be able to be resized up to 200% without causing overlapping issues with other content on the page. Don’t rely on browser zoom, since some users have settings to force large type.\n\n\nColor\n\n\n  Do not use color as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.\n  \n    Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1, but there are exceptions.\n\n    \n      For large text, a contrast ratio of only 3 : 1 is necessary. Large regular text is at least 18pt/24px, while large bold text is 14pt/18px.\n      Text or images of text that are either pure decoration or not visible, or are part of a logo, picture that contains significant other visual content, or inactive UI components (like disabled form controls) do not have a color contrast requirement.\n    \n  \n  The Color Contrast Checker is a good tool for testing color contrast ratios.\n\n\nAudio\n\n\n  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.\n  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.\n\n\nOperable\n\n(view on W3C site)\n\nUser interface components and navigation must be operable: an interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform. Following these guidelines will guarantee that all users can navigate a website or app regardless of their input device (mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, screen reader, etc).\n\nEnsure that all content is keyboard accessible\n\nIn general, if a website can be operated using only the keyboard, it will also be operable with less-common input devices.\n\n\n  All controls must be addressable by the keyboard. By default, this includes &lt;a&gt;, &lt;area&gt;, &lt;object&gt;, and all form elements. Other elements can be made addressable by applying a tabindex value.\n  Avoid keyboard traps. If a user can tab to an element on the page, the user needs to be able to exit that element using only the keyboard as well.\n  Do not rely on specific timing of individual keystrokes when implementing keyboard accessibility.\n\n\nGive users ample time to interact with content\n\nYou should not use time limits. For cases in which time limits are unavoidable:\n\n\n  Allow users to turn off or extend the time limit to at least 10 times the default setting.\n  Warn users at least 20 seconds before a time limit expires and enable a time extension with a simple action, such as pressing the space bar.\n  If a user needs to log in again after a time limit, make sure that there is no loss of data.\n\n\nAvoid interrupting users\n\n\n  Avoid popups or other modal dialogs that haven not been prompted by explicit user action or are alerting the user about something that is time-sensitive.\n  Allow users to pause, stop, or hide anything moving, blinking, or scrolling on the screen if the motion lasts longer than 5 seconds.\n  Allow users to pause, stop, hide, or control the frequency of auto-updating information.\n\n\nDo not create designs or interactions that may cause seizures\n\nNothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.\n\nHelp users navigate, find content, and determine where they are\n\n\n  Allow users to bypass blocks of content that appear repeatedly on a website, like navigation, with a “skip to main content” or similar link.\n  Use titles that describe a webpage’s topic or purpose.\n  Include descriptive section headings to organize content.\n  Unless content is a step in a process, provide more than one way to access it, such as through browsing and search.\n  Provide a breadcrumb trail or other way for the user to identify their location in the site on every page.\n  Use descriptive link text. Avoid calls to action like “click here” or “read more.”\n\n\nManage focus\n\nWhen users navigate a webpage using the keyboard or another alternative input device, only one element on the page will be in focus at a given time.\n\n\n  If the order of controls on a page matters, make sure they will be focused in that order when navigating by keyboard.\n  Make sure there is a visible indicator on screen of which element has focus. This may be an optional mode, but it should be turned on if the user begins to navigate with the keyboard.\n  If a user action causes a modal dialog to appear on screen, make sure the focus is moved to that dialog or area. When the dialog is dismissed, re-focus back to the original control or to some other logical place in the document.\n\n\nUnderstandable\n\n(view on W3C site)\n\nUsers must be able to comprehend content and how to operate an interface.\n\nCreate text content that is machine- and human-readable\n\n\n  Specify the language of the content in a machine-readable way. Generally, this means using &lt;html lang=\"en-us\"&gt; or the equivalent for another language. This will help with translation software and ensures that screen readers will use the correct pronunciation.\n  If part of a document is in a different language from the overall language of the document, specify this with something like &lt;span lang=\"fr\"&gt;.\n  Where possible, provide a way for users to find definitions of unusual words and phrases, especially jargon.\n  Make the meaning of abbreviations and acronyms available, either directly in the text, such as “Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)”, or in a machine-readable way, like &lt;abbr title=\"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\"&gt;CFPB&lt;/abbr&gt;).\n  Write text to an eighth-grade comprehension level, excluding proper names and titles, where possible. If that is not an option, provide a simplified version of the text nearby.\n  For hard-to-pronounce words, consider including the pronunciation.\n\n\nDevelop sites that behave in a predictable way\n\n\n  Related webpages should have a consistent navigation structure and layout.\n  Components that perform the same action should be labelled the same way.\n\n\nMaintain context\n\nAvoid changing a user’s context without an explicit request from the user, like clicking a button. If an automatic context change is necessary, warn the user in advance, and give them an opportunity to stop it.\n\nA few examples of context changes:\n\n\n  Submitting a form\n  Moving focus to a different element\n  Popping open a help dialog box\n  Launching a new window\n  Following a link\n  Reloading most of the content on a page\n\n\nRobust\n\n(View on W3C site)\n\nContent must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. A robust site will be broadly compatible with past, current, and future web browsers and devices.\n\nFollow standard web best practices\n\nThis means using standard HTML markup. If complex widgets are required, use WAI-ARIA to make the use, states, and properties clear to browsers and assistive technologies.\n\n\n  Make sure your HTML validates.\n  Use unique IDs on individual pages.\n  Avoid deprecated or proprietary markup.\n  Make sure states and properties of elements are machine readable.\n\n\nNote that this is specific to HTML and does not include CSS.\n",

If letters are entered in a date field, if an email address is missing the “@” sign, let the user know right away by showing a field-level error on blur.\n\nThat said, it’s a good idea to always validate on the server side even if you use client-side validation for formatting checks. That’s because JavaScript validation may not work on all clients; JavaScript errors could occur no matter the client; and JS validation can easily be bypassed, which raises security concerns.\n\nIn general, the best practice for server-side validation is to mark errors with both form-level and field-level errors.\n",

            'title': 'Conducting research',
            'description': "Build a greater understanding of who you’re working with and how they experience the situation you’re addressing. Research is vital to a successfully project and a mutually-helpful collaboration. \n\n\n\nPractice inclusive recruitment \n\nOnce the goals and objectives of a research initiative are established, it’s important to carefully define the audience (see 18F’s guide for more info) and then to take the time needed to recruit for that audience.   \n\nTo quote 18F, you must do research with people who will actually use your services. It’s counterproductive and potentially harmful to draw conclusions from research conducted with people who are not in the right demographic or target group, or who don’t share the experience or situation that the research aims to understand.\n\nConsider the unintended consequences of your recruitment approach. For example, recruiting via personal networks can lead to hearing only from people who share similar characteristics, values, and beliefs as yourself. Ask yourself whether these people are authentic representatives of the people who will ultimately use your product. Similarly, recruiting via social media can omit people who don’t have internet access at all. These issues are known as sampling bias.     \n\nEven when your study targets the “general population”, take steps to recruit for a diversity of participants, rather than recruiting for convenience (which could potentially introduce sampling bias), or trusting to randomized recruiting. This might include taking steps to recruit and screen for specific groups—here is an incomplete list:    \n\n\n  People with disabilities, who may or may not use assistive technologies   \n  People with limited English proficiency, including newcomers to the United States  \n  Members of the BiPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) community  \n  People in communities who may have limited trust in the government  \n  People with limited or no internet access, or who are smartphone-only  \n  Rural community members   \n  Veterans  \n  Older adults   \n  People who are formerly incarcerated   \n\n\n\n\n  {% include icons/edit.svg %} A﻿CTIVITY\n\n  Frames of reference\n\n  The frames of reference activity can help you and your team think more broadly about different identities and communities to include as part of your research. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor long-term success, invest in relationships with communities and community organizations to establish a collaborative partnership, thereby shifting from transactional to relational recruitment.  \n\nCompensate fairly \n\nIt’s important to pay research participants and community collaborators for the value they contribute to your work. At the Bureau, members of the public who participate in research are almost always paid for their time. Exceptions include employees of institutions either regulated by the CFPB or who work with the CFPB, and federal employees working on government time.   \n\nCompensation models should consider the additional costs some might incur to participate in research. This might include time off from work, child care, and transportation costs.  \n\nIf you are working with or for a federal agency, depending on the structure of your research, compensation may have implications for the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). Be sure to consult your agency guidelines.   \n\nConsider other forms of compensation that have value to the people or community you are researching if you can’t pay them or they decline payment. Some examples of what you could offer:\n\n\n  Curated package of agency resources tailored to the participant’s needs  \n  Technical assistance in the form of trainings or webinars on topics relevant to the participants  \n\n\nTake care not to harm participants through compensation.  \n\nNote at least two ways in which compensation can be problematic: \n\n\n  Undue influence: An excessive or inappropriate offer of compensation is made in order to obtain participant compliance. The amount or type of compensation should never influence people to participate against their better judgment.  \n  Coercion: An overt or implicit threat of harm or negative consequences is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain participant compliance. Compensation for research is not coercive in and of itself, since it does not involve a threat of harm. However, compensation can create potentially coercive situations, as when a third party is paid for another subject’s participation, and that third party can exert coercion over the subject in order to obtain payment.  \n\n\nObtain informed consent  \n\nInformed consent is a person’s or community’s permission to participate in a study or design activity with their full knowledge of possible consequences—both good and bad. People must be able to grant permission free of coercion or undue influence and comprehend what they are agreeing to participate in. They should also be aware of what information will be collected as part of the activity and how their information may be used or shared downstream. \n\nIn practice, this means the participant should be provided the following information before they agree to participate:    \n\n\n  An overview of the nature of the research, the topics covered, and how the research will be conducted   \n  The types of information you may record ( including audio or video) or collect, and how you will use the information \n  How you will share the information collected  \n  That the participant has control over their participation and can stop research at any time  \n\n\nThere may be additional privacy notice requirements if personally identifiable information (PII) is collected from people. Be sure to consult your agency guidelines and the Privacy team. \n\nMake consent forms clear.  \n\nAn important underlying principle is that participants can understand what they’re agreeing to. Make sure that consent forms are written using plain language guidelines. Avoid unnecessarily complex terms or legalese.  \n\nCollect only the bare minimum of information. \n\nCollect, record, and share only the bare minimum of information needed to accomplish the goals of your research, and carefully safeguard that information. See the section on data handling for more information.  \n\nConsent is never binding. \n\nOnce you’ve obtained a participant’s agreement at the beginning of a research session, continue to ask for consent as needed during the research itself. Participants may not have fully understood the implications of what topics might be covered, and specific questions or issues might hit a nerve.  \n\nAnticipate sensitive questions or topics as best you can, and look for signs of trauma. Be prepared to ask your participant if they’d be willing to talk about a topic, and if they’re not, move on, or end the research activity as needed. Note that even if the participant chooses to end research sessions early, they should still be paid for their time.   \n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\n18F’s guide to informed consent  \n\nCheck your biases \n\nAs part of beginning the project for which you’re conducting research, your team ideally spent time uncovering biases and walking through an exercise such as  Frames of reference. If you have not taken those steps yet, considering doing them before entering into research work.  activity\n\nBe aware of how bias can show up during research.  \n\nResearch is the primary time when your team will interact directly with the people you are seeking to help. In order for the research to be as useful as possible, it’s important to look at how bias can show up during the research process. Whether in choices around who participates, what information is collected, or how information is interpreted, there’s always a potential for bias to limit or skew the work. You will not be able to completely remove the potential for bias, but recognizing and proactively working to mitigate it will improve the credibility of your research and design.    \n\nSome specific biases worth noting:  \n\n\n  Sampling bias, where participants are chosen in a way that is not representative of the intended population. For example, recruiting research participants via personal networks can lead to hearing only from those who share similar values and beliefs to yourself. Recruiting via social media can omit people who don’t have internet access.   \n  Social desirability bias, where participants answer questions or give feedback to conform to how they want to be viewed by others. For example, a research participant may say they like a prototype they don’t actually understand, for fear of being perceived negatively if they admit otherwise.   \n  Interview bias and confirmation bias, where we seek or favor information confirming our own prior beliefs and assumptions. If you’re a sighted person, you may omit thinking about the needs of people with low vision when you conduct research. If you design a product and then go on to research it, you may consciously or subconsciously shape the results to support your initial design decisions.   \n\n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\n18F has put together a list of common biases in research. \n\nHandle data and stories with care \n\nSafeguard the data and information gathered from participants in a sensitive manner. Many underserved and underrepresented communities have had historically difficult experiences with the federal government. Safeguarding their PII and maintaining compliance with your organizational data management, privacy, and security standards are important to ensure participants are not vulnerable to further trauma from mishandling of their data, such as a privacy breach.  \n\n18F defines PII as “information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual”; see their research guidelines for a more detailed explanation. \n\nWhen it comes to collecting PII from participants, best practices are as follows:   \n\n\n  Collect only the bare minimum needed to accomplish your research. In practice, most PII, such as names or faces, are not needed and should not be collected. Other PII, such as participants’ voices, may be recorded for internal use only.   \n  Anonymize and aggregate information collected from participants before it’s stored. For example, give each participant a code number (e.g., P01, P02) before saving and storing their data. Refer only to those code numbers, even in your notes, unless you have explicit consent to collect and store PII otherwise. Even if you do have such consent, take all steps necessary to safeguard the privacy of data stored.   \n  Limit access to anonymized data to those conducting the research.   \n  Delete data containing PII when it’s no longer needed.  \n  Consult with your Privacy team before engaging in research to ensure compliance with your organizational and federal standards. \n\n\nRecognize and respond to trauma in participants \n\nTrauma is an event, a series of events, or a set of circumstances experienced by an individual or group as emotionally or physically harmful, and that has lasting effects on their sense of well-being. Research sessions may touch on difficult or sensitive topics. Familiarize yourself with the 4 R’s framework and apply it if needed to avoid re-traumatizing a person.  \n\n\n\n  {% include icons/edit.svg %} A﻿CTIVITY\n\n  The Four R’s\n\n  In this activity, you’ll apply the Four R’s framework, outlined in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma Informed Approach, to your research materials before conducting research. \n\n  Research materials may include your moderator guide, intro script, screeners, consent forms, and co-design materials, among other materials.  \n\n  In applying the 4 R’s framework, you should be able to: \n\n  \n    Identify where there may be potential for participants to show signs of trauma  \n    Plan for how to respond to signs of trauma and build it into your materials  \n    Remove or revise content, script, or questions as needed \n  \n\n  Realize \n\n  Realize the impact that trauma has had on individuals and their interactions with people and systems of power and oppression. Identify historical oppression and policies that have oppressed specific groups. (If you haven’t already taken the time to learn how power structures can affect the people you serve, now would be a good time to do so.)  \n\n  Recognize \n\n  \n    Recognize the signs of trauma when they surface. Some examples include:  \n    Agitation   \n    Crying or other signs of sadness    \n    Nervousness or fidgeting   \n    Zoning out or frequently losing track of the conversation  \n    Visible or audible shakiness \n    Tendency to answer quickly and agree   \n    An abrupt change in attitude  \n  \n\n  Respond \n\n  Respond to trauma with an appropriate action. Here are examples specific to research activities:   \n\n  \n    If you anticipate something might be emotionally difficult for a participant, be prepared to ask for consent throughout the conversation, even if the participant already granted it at the start.   \n    \n      Give the participant the emotional support they need. Connect with them and reinforce that their words are valuable. Be non-judgmental in your responses with the aim of always reducing shame.  \n\n      \n        “Thank you for sharing your experience with us. That must have been difficult.”   \n        “Thank you for trusting me with your story.”  \n        “It must have taken a lot of courage to share this story with me.”  \n        “You don’t need to feel ashamed for the decisions you made.”  \n      \n    \n    \n      Remove time pressure.  \n\n      \n        “Take all the time you need” OR “We can reschedule the session”  \n        “You can step away for a moment at any time. It’s okay.” \n        “Let’s take a pause. I’m going to do a breathing exercise – you are welcome to join me.”  \n      \n    \n    Check in when you think they’re ready to continue   \n    \n      Be prepared to stop if it’s too hard for the participant to continue. \n\n      \n        “I can tell this is hard for you / stirring up emotions. Would you like to take a break or stop?”  \n        “Would you like me to stop recording?”  \n        Dismiss other observers, stop the recording and opt to take handwritten notes if you notice the participant is struggling but wishes to continue.\n      \n    \n    \n      Use non-verbal cues  \n\n      \n        Breath slowly and deeply. (You can even ask the participant to join in)  \n        Avoid fidgeting or moving your hands around a lot  \n        Relax your shoulders and sit squarely in front of the camera for remote sessions  \n        Either sit across from the participant or next to them - ask what they are most comfortable with.  \n      \n    \n  \n\n  Resist re-traumatization \n\n  If a topic area has shown to be traumatizing, revisit the way it’s integrated into your work and consider alternate methods of gathering information. \n\n\n \n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\nMuch of this guidance is based on well-established research and resources from experts.

            'description': "Data visualization can be an excellent way to increase understanding of information and make comparisons of data. Using visuals to convey meaning and tell stories can engage the user and create a memorable experience.\n",
            'use_cases': "It is critical to choose the correct visualization for your data. Make sure you understand the data and the relationship of your data before you decide how to visualize it. It’s also important to ensure your data visualization communicates a main point that users can easily recognize and walk away with.\n\nOccasionally, data visualization isn’t the best approach. A well-crafted sentence or table may work better to convey a specific point or precise numerical interpretation. Graphs are most useful when you want the user to walk away with a general sense of the data and to interpret patterns.\n\nAudience\n\nConsider your audience when creating a visualization.\n\n\n  Who is your audience?\n  What is their familiarity with data visualization?\n  How much information do they need?\n\n\nGeneral public\n\nIf your user group is general (i.e. the American public), stick with basic and most common chart types that people can easily understand. Adding emphasis and labels will help highlight the point of the visual and tell the story of the information. Consider using multiple simple charts to step the user through the data, rather than one big complex visualization.\n\nSpecific users\n\nIf your data visualization is designed with a specific audience in mind, take into consideration their familiarity with the data, visualization types, and terminology used to label and describe data. More complex stories might necessitate more complex visuals, however, this does not mean it should lack emphasis.\n",
            'guidelines': "Whether you’re using Excel, Tableau, D3.js, or any other program, follow these guidelines to create effective and consistent data visualizations.\n\nFont\n\nAll data, labels, and titles for data visualizations should be in a sans-serif font. While serif fonts are generally easier to read for long blocks of text, data visualizations rarely include long blocks. The lack of serifs, especially on numbers, helps cut down on the amount of lines and visual clutter. This lack also increases the legibility of small text by eliminating thin serifs.\n\n\n  Use Avenir Next if it is available.\n  If Avenir Next is not available, use Arial.\n\n\nUsing the appropriate font not only increases consistency with the core brand, it assures legibility and good visual hierarchy.\n\nColor\n\nWhen used properly, color can help clarify relationships between data, provide emphasis for certain data points, and maintain a consistent brand voice. When used poorly, color can overwhelm the user, make the data confusing, and break with brand standards.\n\nWhen using color, ensure the following.\n\n\n  Your use of color has a purpose.\n  You’re not relying solely on color to connote meaning. Use other visual qualities such as patterning to distinguish between data points.\n  You’ve accounted for color blindness. We use specific color combinations to create accessible, on-brand data visualizations. View our data visualization color palettes. We also have a set of guidelines detailing the accessible use of color in both web and print. View color accessibility guidelines.\n\n\nChart components\n\nElements such as clear titles and proper labeling help users quickly understand data visualizations, increase comprehension, and contribute to accessibility.\n\n\n\nFigure number\n\nThe figure number style varies depending on where the data visualization is presented.\n\n\n  In a report, use the Figure number style (all caps).\n  On a web page, use the H5 heading style.\n  On a blog or social post, do not include a figure number.\n\n\nTitle\n\nTitles should be as descriptive as possible to give users a sense of what the chart will be about and ensure someone who cannot see the chart can understand the general trends. This provides users a framework of what they are viewing. It also helps with 508 accessibility and decreases the amount of text necessary in alt tags.\n\n\n  Write the title to provide an overview of what the graph is about.\n  Use the h3 heading style.\n  Include no more than two lines of text.\n\n\nSubtitle\n\nAs with a title, ensure your data visualization has a descriptive subtitle.\n\n\n  Write the subtitle to explain the general trends of the graph and what that means, including why it is important.\n  Use the body text paragraph style.\n  Include no more than three lines of text.\n\n\nNotes\n\nInclude notes with your data visualization to describe any caveats or inconsistencies with the data. For instance, when using charts that show percentages, users expect numbers to add up to 100%. Not adding up to 100% undermines the integrity of the visuals by leaving the user with missing pieces.\n\nTo remedy this effect, add a note at the bottom to explain the missing data.\n\n\n  Example: “Percentages may not sum to 100% due to rounding.”\n\n\nYou can also use notes to add in other caveats, such as if the data was taken from a specific time period.\n\n\n  Example: “Percent change is based on a 3-month period (October-December) and compared to the previous year.”\n  Example: “Company-level information should be considered in context of total complaints, company size, and market share in a given geographic area.\n\n\nData source\n\nIt is important to clearly state where data is from to promote trustworthiness and validity. If possible, provide a link to the URL of a spreadsheet or to the source of the data. This will enable people to dive deeper into the data, explore the nuances for themselves, and replicate the visualization themselves.\n\nLabels and key\n\nWhenever possible, place labels directly on the data visualization rather than putting labels in a key. Direct labeling reduces the cognitive burden for a user by preventing them from having to hunt for labels or try to connect color meaning to the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo\n\nIf the data visualization appears on its own, such as in a social media post, include the CFPB logo. This will help with identification and determining the graphic’s origin if it gets reused.\n\nCreating emphasis\n\nHighlighting parts of your chart will help users quickly understand the point of the graphic and accurately comprehend the information.\n\nWhen considering how to create emphasis, ask yourself the following.\n\n\n  What is the point of the chart?\n  Can someone who hasn’t seen the chart before figure out the point from a quick look and the title?\n\n\nTo help create emphasis, ensure your visualization has a strong visual hierarchy. This will allow the user to focus on the most important piece of content first and work their way into the graphic.\n\nCheck hierarchy with a squint test\n\nThe title and subtitle should be the biggest and first things the user reads when viewing the chart to give them context of what the chart is about. Take a step back from your data visualization, squint your eyes, and say what you see first, second, third, and so on. This will give you a sense what your users will likely identify first.\n\nUse labels to call out information\n\nGoals, trends, and important outliers should be highlighted with labels to help the user discern what is going on with the data.\n\nDeemphasize projected values\n\nWhen dealing with projected or predicted data, the predicted data should be deemphasized. Use a color change to a lighter tint or dashed outline for bar charts, a dotted line for line charts, and a label explaining what part of the data is predicted or projected.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring accuracy\n\nA chart is only as good as the validity of its data. It is important to check both the data and chart several times with multiple people before publishing. One small error can invalidate the integrity of an entire visualization. Several errors in data accuracy can damage credibility. Include notes with your data visualization to describe any caveats or inconsistencies and be sure to clearly state where data is from to promote trustworthiness and validity.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, ask yourself the following.\n\n\n  Is this an accurate way to represent this data?\n  Did someone else look at the chart and data for feedback?\n  If there are percentages, do they add up to 100%? Why not?\n  What is the source of the data?\n\n",

            'accessibility': "Allowing all users to be able to comprehend data visualizations is a key part of being a government agency that serves the entire American public.\n\nWhen building your data visualization, it’s important to ensure the following.\n\n\n  Include descriptive titles.\n  Be mindful of your use of color. Do not rely solely on color to connect data to its meaning, account for color blindness, and ensure adequate color contrast.\n\n\nAlt tags\n\nAlt tags are what a screen reader will say instead of the image. This is important for not only web materials but also for charts that are in pdfs and charts that are placed as images into word documents. Screen readers read all of the text in an alt tag without allowing users to speed up or skip. Make sure the information in the alt tag is descriptive but succinct.\n\n\n  When writing an alt tag, include one sentence of what the chart is, including the chart type, for users with limited vision who can see part of it but may not be able to have a full understanding of the graph. Example: “Bar chart showing complaints by type for New York metro area, New York state and the United States.”\n  Link to a CSV or other machine-readable data format with the data so people with impaired vision can tab through the data with a screen reader. The data should have descriptive column labels and provide a link.\n\n\nWhen determining how to create an accessible data visualization, ask yourself the following.\n\n\n  How would someone using a screen reader interact with this visualization?\n  How would someone with low vision interact with this visualization?\n\n",

            'description': "Designing and developing for more equitable access starts with an awareness of the power imbalances between ourselves and the people we serve.\n\n\n\nA﻿ccessibility\n\nAccessibility means designing for people with a wide range of abilities so that they have equitable access to the tools and resources we provide. All people we serve should have an inclusive experience, including those with visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and other impairments. \n\nThere are federal requirements around accessibility that we as a federal agency are required to meet. The revised Section 508 standards of 2018 in effect state that all electronic content should conform to WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines. As such, we design, build, test, and remediate to conform to those standards.  \n\nIf you’re building web or print products:\n\n\n  Read our accessibility guidelines before you begin the design process.\n  Audit your product for Section 508 compliance before it is launched. \n\n\nAccess\n\nProviding equitable access to web-based products means building with an eye towards the needs of people who rely on smaller or older devices and/or those using low-bandwidth networks. As of August 2022, more than half of all visitors to the CFPB’s website use a mobile device. The ratio is even higher for our Spanish-language content, where three-quarters of visitors use a mobile device. Also consider the 25% of Americans who do not have high-speed internet access at home.\n\nEnsure you’re taking the steps below: \n\nDesign and research from a mobile-first standpoint.  \n\nDesigning to a limited screen size helps to force prioritization of the most important features needed to accomplish the goals of your product, and encourages the development of a leaner product. In contrast, designing desktop-first may lead to the development of multiple features without hierarchy or prioritization, which may not be usable at mobile scale. \n\nOptimize code for the best possible performance. \n\nCode should be as lightweight as possible. Evaluate your product for performance factors, such as first contentful paint, first meaningful paint, and speed index. Use one of the many free automated tools available to analyze speed, performance, and quality. \n\nWorking mobile-first and optimizing for performance and accessibility has SEO benefits as well. The most frequently-used search engines have moved to favoring mobile friendly sites and accessible features. \n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\nRead the Pew Research Center’s fact sheet on internet and broadband usage (April 2021)\n\nInclusive imagery\n\nBe thoughtfully inclusive about how you represent people in photography and illustration. This goes beyond showing a wide range of ethnicities and abilities in a single visual product. Careful thought must be put into who is shown, in what context, and how they are represented.  \n\nTake these steps whether you’re casting a video, creating illustrations of people, choosing stock photography, or something else. \n\nUncover your own assumptions and biases. \n\nIf you haven’t already, take steps to uncover the assumptions and biases you hold, and to raise awareness of the needs of communities and groups that are different from yourself and your team, by running through the frames of reference exercise.   \n\nUnderstand the group you’re representing and trying to reach. \n\nIf there is a specific group you’re trying to reach and that you plan to represent in your product, do your research so that you’re aware of any sensitivities. Investigate their historic and current relationship to the government and their relationship to the topic you’re representing. There may be negative connotations or associations that you’re not aware of when you represent a specific group in a specific situation.  \n\nMake sure that any representations of people experiencing a difficult or undesirable situation do not reinforce existing negative stereotypes. \n\nExamine potential hazards and harms.  \n\nRun through the hazards and harms that could occur as a result of your deliverable. In particular, be on the lookout for any representations that might perpetuate such hazards as racial profiling, enshrined status quo and power structures, and systemic bias.  \n\nHazards and harms\n\nIn a Medium article from 2019, the design researcher and author Erika Hall suggests annotating wireframes with hazards and harms. The concept is similar to occupational safety maps that annotate floor plans with specific physical, chemical, and electrical hazards. \n\nAs an example of how this might work, an abuser could use a searchable database containing personally-identifiable information to find the location of a victim. The hazards of this database could include data misuse and targeted abuse.

They are meant to call attention to a related piece of content that might be new or otherwise relevant to — but not directly a part of — the main content on the page, the primary intended user action, or the user journey.\n\nThe goal of an FCM is to have the user do one of three things: learn something (usually by navigating to other content), watch something, or download something (a printable tool or resource). FCMs can appear on any page type, though they are best suited for pages third level and below in the site map.\n\nFCM content shouldn’t be seen as integral to the page, meaning it could be changed or removed without taking away vital information the user needs or interrupting the user journey. Therefore, this module is not intended to support the site IA as the primary, permanent location for content. When the content is an integral, long-term part of the intended user journey, then it should have a more permanent home on the page.\n\nUse a featured content module (FCM) when you want to highlight something that’s:\n\n\n  Timely: Highlights a new tool or development. Keep in mind: When you remove dated content from a FCM, make sure you’re not getting rid of the only way users can navigate to it. Make sure to plan a permanent home for the content.\n  Impactful: Lets people know immediately how the content will affect them, how they can use it, and how it might enhance their understanding of — or experience with — the primary page content.\n  Localized: New content that specifically applies to people in a specific geographic area; it may be important for that audience to see their specific content first, and when it’s removed from the page it won’t disrupt the usual user flow.\n  Unique: Content that is specifically in the Bureau’s “wheelhouse” because of our position as an approachable, trusted, unbiased authority.\n\n\nWhen there’s no link or video for the user to interact with, and you still want to visually differentiate your content from its surroundings, consider using a well or inline text instead.\n",
            'guidelines': "Content guidelines\n\nFCMs contain a headline, descriptive body copy text, an optional call-to-action link, and a graphical element related to the piece of content being featured. They are a “mini story” and never simply a dominant visual.\n\n\n  Headings should be as succinct as possible and 35 characters or less (including spaces).\n  Descriptions should be action-oriented and let the user know what they will get out of the featured content and how it’s related to the main page content, not just what it is. Descriptions should be 160 characters or less (including spaces).\n  Links serve as a call-to-action, so they should begin with an action verb like “explore,” “read,” “learn,” or “discover.” When using an action verb, be specific and tie the action back to the content and what the user will get from it. As a best practice, only include up to one link in a FCM. Link text should be 35 characters or less (including spaces).\n  Do not include a link with a video FCM. In a FCM that features video, the desired action is for the user to play the video, so the play button serves as a visual call-to-action. This makes it especially important for the description in the FCM to be action-oriented. Encourage users to take the action of watching the video, and relate directly back to the video content and what they’ll get out of it.\n\n\nStylistic guidelines\n\nText is full-width and displayed above the visual in the default/mobile view. When creating a static image for the visual, it should be 1076px × 606px (a 16:9 aspect ratio), which is 2x the rendered width at the maximum size at which the visual will be seen (on a 600px wide display).\n",
            'behavior': "\n  \n    \n      Above 600 px\n      Below 601 px\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nResponsive visual behavior\n\nAt desktop size, the ratio of text and visual changes with screen size to keep the full height of the image visible. As available width dips below the maximum page width, the text area shrinks in width while the visual maintains a fixed width of 270px. That means that the height and aspect ratio of the visual will change as the screen shrinks, and the image will be cropped between 16% and 29% from each side.\n\nAt larger screen sizes, the image moves to the right of the text, occupying a fixed width of 270px (equal to 3 of 12 columns at max page width). By default, the left edge of the image is anchored to the left side of the visual’s 270px-wide area, and the right side is cropped off. The aspect ratio of the visual area increases as screen size increases, resulting in slightly different image cropping at different screen sizes, but the left edge of the image remains anchored in view. The full height of the image is always in view; the top and bottom are never cropped. See above for modifiers that change the image’s horizontal anchoring.\n",

They should serve as the backbone for the user experience, ensuring that the standards we set enable products that are easy to use and understand for consumers.\n\n\n\n  Public service, public trust\n\n  We aim to win the public’s trust through honest, transparent design. Using clear, concise, and approachable design, we focus on consumers. We demonstrate transparency through our user-friendly online experiences and tools and our dedication to open-source content.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Giving the user control\n\n  We design to empower users with information. The CFPB motivates consumers to take the control of their financial decision-making, and our designs enable this process. Good design increases transparency and succinctly hands the user all the necessary information, giving consumers control of how they use it. Designers must rely on introspection and research to discover what path users instinctively take and then cater to those instincts.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Aesthetic integrity\n\n  Aesthetic integrity is not merely “attractiveness”; it implies the successful integration of design and function. We align appearance with purpose by using clear and intuitive designs to create a trustworthy tone and powerful platform for supporting the CFPB’s mission. We maintain consistency and clarity to empower users to seamlessly transfer their knowledge and skills from one product to another. Focusing on consistency helps uphold aesthetic integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Designing with data\n\n  Design gives voice to data, and data informs design. Because the CFPB is a data-driven organization, quantitative measures of success should be integral to the design process. Design should incorporate data to aid understanding of complex issues, and data-driven feedback should influence the design process. Succinct and compelling visualization of information gives data a voice and helps us clarify otherwise indigestible numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Inclusion and accessibility\n\n  We design for the widest possible demographic with bias toward clear articulation, plain language, and intuitive design. We design to meet each consumer where he or she is. We are sensitive to experiential level, timing, and biases and aim to design experiences that are equally accessible to everyone, and equally empowering no matter what the user’s skill set or familiarity. Simple, clean designs are the most effective and wide-reaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Coherent end-to-end user experience\n\n  We aim to unify parts of the user experience and transition seamlessly between them. The best design guides the user’s experience from beginning-to-end and caters to his or her expectations. Navigation between sections should be intuitive and transitions should be seamless. Consistent quality and attention to detail are essential to maintain a cohesive user experience.\n\n\n",

Copy should be succinct and engaging, reflecting the voice and tone of the CFPB.\n\nDo\n\n\n  \n    Write hero copy from the user’s perspective.\n\n    \n      Orient the user: “Is this page what I was looking for?”\n      Engage the user: “Do I want to keep reading?”\n    \n  \n\n\nDon’t\n\n\n  Don’t write copy from the perspective of what the Bureau does or offers. It’s less about what we can do for them or what we can offer them, and more about what the user can do with the resources we provide.\n  Don’t include links or calls to action within the hero. The goal of the hero is to get the user to continue reading the page, and calls to action  detract from that. If there’s content that needs to link elsewhere for explanation, place it underneath the hero, within the main content area.\n\n\nHeadings\n\nCommunicate what the user can learn from the page or the benefit the page provides. Actionable, descriptive, orienting statements work best.\n\nHeadings should be a single phrase, preferably one line at the largest breakpoint. Take care to avoid orphaned text.\n\nHeadings should not include a period at the end. Question marks can be used when a question is asked, but avoid phrasing heroes as questions.\n\n\n  One-line (at largest breakpoint): 41 characters maximum\n  Two-line (at largest breakpoint): 82 characters maximum\n\n\nSubheading content\n\nCopy underneath the heading should be brief, enticing, and build upon the heading to describe the value of the page. Take care to avoid orphaned text.\n\n\n  After one-line heading: Between 165 and 186 characters (three lines at largest breakpoint)\n  After two-line heading: Between 108 and 124 characters (two lines at largest breakpoint)\n\n",

            'guidelines': "Icon artboard\n\nBecause our icons typically appear beside text we designed our icon artboards (in Illustrator) to match the vertical footprint of Avenir Next. Avenir Next text set to a font size of 16px has a rendered height of 19px. To account for the additional white space, we set the icon artboards to 19px (h).\n\n\n\nRelative sizing\n\nWhen typing or placing an icon next to Avenir Next in print or web, all icons should have a similar size. In developing the icons, we created two sizing grids, a smaller one that fits within the standard circle, and a larger one for non-circle icons. This allows icons to have a similar visual prominence, whether inside or outside of the circle.\n\n\n\nAlignment\n\nThe overall position of a circle icon is centered on the cap height of Avenir Next. Within the circle, the icon is centered optically.\n\nThe alignment of non-circle icons depends on the icon height in relation to the footprint of Avenir Next. For more horizontal icons, vertically centering the icon on the cap height of Avenir Next often leaves it floating. To solve this, we start the grid on the baseline for more horizontal icons. For more vertical icons that exceed the cap height of Avenir Next, we center the icon on the cap height.\n\n\n\nColor\n\nThe color of an icon should match the color of neighboring text. This setting is built into our code and happens automatically, provided that the icon is within the same parent element as the text. If the icon sits outside of the text’s parent element the color must be applied manually but should still match the color of the text.\n\nCode examples:\n\n\n  Heading color automatically applied to the icon: &lt;h2&gt;{icon} Heading text&lt;/h2&gt;\n  Heading color must be manually applied to the icon: &lt;div&gt;{icon}&lt;h2&gt;Heading text&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nScale\n\nIcons should be scaled relative to the size of neighboring text. This setting is built into our code and happens automatically, provided that the icon is within the same parent element as the text. If the icon sits outside of the text’s parent element the scaling must be applied manually but the icon should still be scaled relative to the size of the text.\n\nIn code, the SVG height is scaled to match the rendered text height, calculated by dividing the rendered height by the assigned font size (19/16 = 1.1875em). This appears in the code as @cf-icon-height: 1.1875em.\n\nCode examples:\n\n\n  Icon is automatically scaled relative to the heading size: &lt;h2&gt;{icon} Heading text&lt;/h2&gt;\n  Icon must be manually scaled relative to the heading size: &lt;div&gt;{icon}&lt;h2&gt;Heading text&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n",
            'behavior': "SVG icon basics\n\nThe cfpb-icons component provides Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) icons. The filenames of the SVGs included with cfpb-icons match the names in the icon library section. We encourage using your templating system to inject the SVG icon files, as opposed to copying and pasting the raw SVG.\n\nNote: Jinja2, the templating language that consumerfinance.gov uses, has a near-identical syntax for includes, but it requires that the path be enclosed in quotation marks, like so: {% include 'icons/download.svg' %}.\n\nWhat the Less is doing\n\nIf you look in cfpb-icons.less  you can see that we have encoded class=\"cf-icon-svg\" in the root element of each of our SVG icons. As a result, the Less rule gets applied to all of the SVGs on the page, just like any other HTML element.\n\nWe start by limiting the size of the SVG to a proportion of the text height, using the @cf-icon-height variable’s em value. To align the canvas of the icon with the canvas of neighboring text, we set vertical-align: text-top;. Finally, setting fill: currentColor; tells the SVG to set its path’s fill color to match the color value of its parent element.\n\nInline SVG background\n\nIn some cases we embed an SVG as a background image. To accomplish this, a custom Less plugin is used to inject the SVG icon source file inline into the CSS background-image property. This is exposed via a mixin, .u-svg-inline-bg( @name, @color: @black ), where @name is the SVG icon canonical name and @color is the SVG fill color (which defaults to black).\n\nInteraction details\n\nPlease reference the Links page for guidance regarding icons paired with links.\n",

Illustrations should also make use of 100% white and black. Visit the color page for color values.\n\nComposition\n\nAll illustrations should have relative sizing when more than one object is included. Illustrations should appear natural, but stylized. Do not scale-up or collage minicons or isocons for use in illustrations. Minicons can be used as graphic details when scaled appropriately.\n\nIllustrations should be compositionally balanced with related headers and text. Reduce “floating” by bleeding illustrations off the edges of the graphic. Make use of layering and subtle, vector-based background patterns to help ground the illustration. Shadows are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects.\n\nDo not use negative space to define outlines.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nForm\n\nAll illustrations should be based on commonly used geometric shapes like circles, triangles, beams, and rectangles.\n\nTo stylize illustrations according to CFPB standards, use relative sizing on stroke weights with a rounded end cap. For curved lines, the stylized stroke is recommended throughout illustrations.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nShading and highlights\n\nObjects should be lit from the upper-left side. This is consistent with the beam in our logo. The overall placement of highlights and shading should be carefully decided by the designer and consistent throughout the project.\n\nShading should be achieved using subtle, solid tints, not gradients, textures, multiply, or blurs.\n\nThere are two types of highlights available for illustrations; curved and diagonal. The curved highlight is recommended when the object is round. Diagonal highlights are mostly used in rectangular objects. They are also frequently used to show reflections. To create a diagonal highlight, a tint of the background color is cast from the top-right corner of an object at a 45º angle.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nShadows\n\nShadows are created using a darker tint of the background color. They are appropriate when objects overlap but should not extend outside of objects.

You can download the compiled Design System CSS and JavaScript from UNPKG.\n\nDownload the cfpb-design-system.css and cfpb-design-system.js files to your project and use standard &lt;link&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags to include them. For example:\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;My Awesome Project&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/cfpb-design-system.css\"&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/your-project-styles.css\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Your project's HTML goes here. --&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"js/cfpb-design-system.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"js/your-project-scripts.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n",

A beam pattern provides grounding and an engaging graphic reference to the beam concept in our logo.\n\n  Beam patterns are composed of overlapping beams that frame areas of white space used for titles, text, and other graphic elements. Beams always point horizontally, not vertically.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Solid green beam bleeds off the top of the layout. Beams alternate direction to create layered beam shapes.\n\n  \n\n  Layered beams anchor to the bottom, leaving plenty of white space above for type. This works especially well for horizontal layouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Base shapes\n\n  Beam patterns are created using trapezoids and parallelograms each at a 9° angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Color\n\n  Beam patterns include all three CFPB Green tones. Using transparency increases the strength of the beam metaphor. Transparency should be achieved through opacity, not blending modes like multiply / darken / etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Misuse\n\n  {% include icons/error-round.svg %} Don’t remove the light beam.

            'description': " This guide contains initial steps for designers, researchers, and developers at the CFPB to help give the communities we design for greater power and authority in the design and research process.\n\nAbout equity-centered design\n\nTraditional human-centered design and research practices aim to understand and solve for the needs of the people we serve, but with limited input from those people. Designers, researchers, developers, and stakeholders work together to determine goals, what questions to ask, what conclusions to draw, and ultimately what solutions to build. Collectively, we have the power to control the narrative for those we are trying to help.\n\nWithout better input from the people impacted by our work, especially those in underserved or underrepresented communities, we risk making decisions and creating solutions that do not help them. The natural limits of our own experience may lead us to omit critical perspectives or possibly even create solutions that cause harm.\n\nEquity-centered design and research aims to give power back to the community by purposefully making all the people we design for collaborators in the design and research process.\n\nAbout these guidelines\n\nThis guide is meant to help increase our awareness of the power we hold in the design and research process, and to take steps to give more power to those we serve to allow their voices to be heard equitably. We’ve written this guide for use in the context of design, user research, and technology development projects, but we hope it may be of use to any one involved in building solutions for diverse audiences.  The ultimate goal is to infuse equity-centered principles into all our processes and practices to better ensure the products and services we build are actually useful for those who need them the most.\n\nBe sure to always look for opportunities to standardize these principles as part of your everyday work. Reconsider recruitment practices, incentives, and how you interact with individuals and communities throughout the lifecycle of a project. Ask yourself, “how is my work contributing to building long-lasting relationships with the organizations, communities, and people the Bureau serves?”\n\nThis is a living document. We will continually reflect on our practices and revisit or add to these ideas as we grow, change, and learn more.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThese guidelines are based upon the great work of others who are already working diligently in the justice and equity space. Acknowledgments are in order:\n\n\n  Ben Peterson and Julie Strothman’s presentation on equity-centered design and research is the primary source of information and inspiration for these guidelines.

Based on the image’s purpose, consider if an illustration, custom photo, or stock photo would best serve that purpose.  \n\nIllustration\n\nIllustration can help explain complex processes. Illustration also has the ability to be socially and politically neutral. Visit the Illustration page for more guidance. \n\nPhotography\n\nPhotography can show real-life scenarios and people. Photography has the ability to convey a serious tone, which may be better suited than illustrations for complicated, sensitive subject matter.  \n\n\n  Custom photography allows you to determine several details such as a photo’s background, props, models, and color palette. Custom photos require planning and coordination, and it is difficult to capture a spontaneous environment, such as a natural disaster, in a custom photo.   \n  Stock photography offers a range of complex scenes and is instantly available so does not require photoshoot planning. A stock photo’s details cannot be controlled, so pay careful attention to its details to ensure it feels authentic.\n\n",
            'guidelines': "Platform and format \n\nWhen determining an image, consider how and where it will be viewed. Will it appear in a social media post with the primary goal of attracting attention? Will it serve as an introductory, supplemental image on a web page? \n\nAn image’s dimensions can also impact what’s possible. If the image appears in the hero pattern, text will sit on top of it and need to be readable across breakpoints. If the image accompanies body copy in an info unit group, it will have limited space.  \n\nPerformance \n\nWhen deciding to use photos on consumerfinance.gov pages, be mindful of how they may impact the page’s performance, such as how long it takes for the page to load. This is an important consideration, as some users may not have broadband internet. \n\n\n  Avoid using multiple photos on a page, as this can significantly weigh down the page. \n  Photos on consumerfinance.gov should be a PNG format, 72 dpi, RGB, and exported at 2x size to appear clearly on retina screens. A photo’s dimensions depend on the pattern in which the photo will appear, so reference the “design specs” tab on a pattern’s page to export a photo at correct dimensions. \n  Check a web page’s performance by using a tool such as Lighthouse. To run Lighthouse in Chrome, click View &gt; Developer and select “Developer Tools” from the drop-down menu. A panel will appear in your browser window. At the top of the panel, click the “Audits” tab. If you do not see an “Audits” tab, click the right-facing arrow and select “Lighthouse” from the drop-down menu. Select “Performance” and generate the Lighthouse report. Review and address any alerts relating to the images.\n\n\nTone \n\nA photo can instantly convey a feeling. Regardless of what a photo depicts, aim for photos in CFPB materials to have the following qualities: \n\n\n  Approachable \n  Actionable \n  Authoritative \n  Authentic \n\n\nThese qualities come through in a photo’s visual details. Aim to achieve the following details when shooting photos or choosing stock images.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Visual detail\n      Example\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Natural interaction If the photo shows people, their body language and facial expressions feel natural and not staged.\n      \n    \n    \n      Authentic atmosphere The photo’s atmosphere feels warm, relatable, and like you’re glimpsing into a real scenario.\n      \n    \n    \n      Inclusive When photographing or choosing images, consider skin color, age, gender identity, income level, and range of ability. Be inclusive and representative of the American public. Be mindful not to reinforce stereotypes.\n       \n    \n    \n      Feeling of being in control When showing a person accomplishing a task, the composition feels organized and actionable.\n      \n    \n  \n\n",

So if this needs to be standardized, a select facilitates this standardization.\n    \n  \n  \n    The list options are familiar to the user.\n\n    \n      A select is not a good place to introduce new or complicated terms or concepts.\n      For instance, if the question is “What’s your favorite color of the rainbow,” a select could be a good choice.

The default components are a poor choice for the visually impaired. If a multiselect component is desired, use custom JavaScript to make it accessible.\n",

            'description': "Before we’re able to design equitable and inclusive products for the people and communities we serve, we must first turn our attention to the ways in which we work.\n\n\n\nWorking together\n\nIdentify lived experiences and biases\n\nInvestigate internalized oppression\n\nUse bias-free, person-centered language\n\nEstablish team values\n\nAssemble diverse teams\n\nIdentify lived experiences and biases\n\nBias is the tendency to allow personal opinions and past experiences to influence one’s judgment. Many of these biases may be unconscious, but they are nonetheless damaging to others. They are often based on false stereotypes about a particular group. It’s part of the human condition to rely on these cognitive shortcuts and to assume others think like us or have similar values, opinions, and beliefs.\n\nBias can skew our research and design activities, whether in our choice of who participates, what information is collected, or how information is interpreted. Awareness of our biases is key to mitigating against them, and that’s where the frames of reference exercise can be particularly valuable.\n\n{% include icons/favorite.svg %} Ready to conduct research for your project? Learn how to check your biases when moderating a research session.\n\n\n\n\n  {% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY\n  Frames of reference\n  Adapted from 18F’s presentation on equity-centered design and research\n\n  As a team, run through this activity to identify your individual and collective biases before beginning research or design activities. If possible, couple the exercise with a review of what you have learned about the audience.\n\n  Everyone should choose how they want to participate, but ideally this can be a group activity.\n  Template\n  We’ve created a template that teams can use to run the activity, available in several formats, including as a template for teams that use Mural as a digital collaboration tool:\n  \n  \n      PDF\n  \n  \n      PNG\n  \n  \n      Mural\n  \n\n  Instructions\n  The template guides teams through the three main phases of the activity.\n  \n  \n    To begin, brainstorm as a team what frames of reference are most important for your team to reflect on. The template contains a number of common frames of reference. More examples can be found in 18F’s frames of reference form.\n  \n  \n    Next, add your experiences with each frame of reference. The template gives a number of options for doing that in a way that's safe and comfortable for everyone, including:\n      \n        \n          Asking participants to add their findings anonymously to the team's collaboration tool, emphasizing that everyone should choose how they wish to participate in this activity\n        \n        \n          Gathering and organizing anonymized responses as a team\n        \n        \n          Reflecting on your own lived experiences individually\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    Finally, brainstorm biases that might arise and make a plan to mitigate them.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\n\n  The positionality wheel is another form of the Frames of Reference exercise.\n  The Decision Lab has a list of the most relevant cognitive biases in behavioral economics, which can be applied to our own biases as designers and researchers, but also participants.\n  Nielsen Norman Group has several resources pertaining to bias in UX. Watch their video, Decision Biases Affecting UX Practitioners, to learn how to mitigate your own biases.\n\n\nInvestigate internalized oppression\n\nWe encourage everyone to read widely to examine their own identity and internalized oppression—the false narratives or stereotypes that they may have internalized about themselves, and how they might perpetuate systemic oppression.\n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\nFor more information, Intentional Futures has a useful explanation of systemic oppression and how it manifests in their Introduction to Equity-Centered Design. Additionally, consider using the implicit bias test put together by Harvard, which is designed to identify unconscious positive and negative associations based on race.\n\nUse bias-free, person-centered language\n\nIt’s important to use clear, respectful, inclusive language that’s free of stereotypes and generalizations. Our words matter, whether we’re addressing the general public or a fellow team member. Follow the guidelines below:\n\nEnsure the terms and references you use to refer to a group are both respectful and accurate.\nSome terms may not be accurate to describe a group, while other terms can have negative connotations. For example, as 18F points out, the term “American Indians and Alaskan Natives” is not an all-encompassing term for Indigenous Americans, as it does not include members of non-federally-recognized tribes, or Indigenous Americans who are not members of a tribe.\n\nUse the terminology that groups and individuals use for themselves. This includes the gender pronouns of any individuals you work with directly. Do your research, read the resources listed in the “Further Reading” section below, and ask members of the group in question directly if you’re in doubt.\n\nUse people-first language.\nPeople-first language is a way to respectfully acknowledge the humanity of an individual or group first, rather than the identity or condition they may experience. Examples of people-first language include “people with a mental disorder”, rather than calling someone “mentally ill”, or referring to someone as a “person without housing”, rather than as a “homeless person”. The specific terms preferred by an individual or group can vary, and do not always include people-first syntax; additionally, language is always changing. Refer to the resources in the “Further Reading” section below to better understand how to use people-first language, and always ask people directly how they wish to define themselves.\n\nConsider avoiding the word “user” when referring to the people we serve.\nIn line with using people-first language, consider using the word “people” instead of “user” when referring to those we’re trying to help. “User” can depersonalize our intended audience, potentially reducing them to a one-dimensional data point. “People”, in contrast, acknowledges the many distinct individuals who are interacting with the services we create for them, and helps us think collectively about the multiplicity of their viewpoints and lived experiences.\n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\n\n  APA’s Bias Free Language Guide, in particular their Inclusive Language Guidelines\n  Language, Please\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  {% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY\n  ﻿Set intentional language\n\n  Take time during your team formation and when beginning a new project to review the guidelines and references above. APA’s Bias Free Language Guide and Language, Please are both excellent guides to inclusive language, and contain robust lists of appropriate person- and identity- first terms. Discuss this guidance as a team and come to a shared understanding of language to use.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablish team values\n\nDiscussing and documenting your team values will enable your group to create a shared understanding of how you want to work together and why you’re making those choices. Revisit your team values throughout your work to stay grounded in your intentions.\n\n\n\n  {% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY\n  Create a set of equity-centered team values\n\n  For newly established teams, create team values that incorporate the results of both the frames of reference and intentional language exercises above. An example of team values could include, embracing discomfort, vulnerability, the awareness that we do not know everything, and understanding that just because we have not experienced something does not make it untrue.\n\n  Once you’ve created your team values, find opportunities to regularly review your values as a team. For example, read these values during your sprint planning ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\nAssemble diverse teams\n\nOrganizational leaders and managers should prioritize assembling teams with a diversity of lived experiences. Diversity is broad; it is the practice or quality of including or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nWhile this includes individuals of different races, genders, religions, sexual orientations, etc., it also includes individuals of different economic, geographic, or other backgrounds. In a diverse environment, every person has different knowledge, perspectives, and points of view that help us make better informed decisions. Assembling a diverse team can be informed by individual teams running the frames of reference activity and giving input to their leaders.\n\nBeginning a project\n\nUnderstand the project’s value\n\nLearn how power structures can affect the people you serve\n\nExamine your biases in the context of the project\n\nApply trauma-informed principles\n\nUnderstand the project’s value\n\nBefore a project begins, come to a shared understanding of its value—that is, a clear sense of the intended outcomes and value that key decision-makers envision creating. This is necessary to truly understand how the project might impact the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n  {% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY\n  Write a problem statement\n\n  Before engaging in any work, stakeholders and the project team should work together to create a problem statement identifying and framing the problem to explore through research or solve through design. Nielsen Norman has more about how to form a problem statement. 18F also has a design hypothesis exercise that considers the value and impact of work on the intended audience.\n\n  The team should also engage in activities to validate the problem statement once it’s been formed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn how power structures can affect the people you serve\n\nIf your product is for an underserved or underrepresented community, do some research.\n\n\n  Research from a reliable source the community’s current and historical relationship with the government, along with an awareness of their history.\n  Investigate any injustices the community has faced at the hands of the government and any historic mistrust that has resulted.\n  Take time to learn about the regulations and/or policies currently in place which might affect the people and communities for who you are designing. Dig in to learn about how those policies evolved to be what they are today.\n  Explore any tension that might impact how you are perceived as a representative of the Federal government when engaging with these communities.\n\n\nAs 18F points out in their presentation on equity-centered design and research, people often access government services in their most vulnerable moments. Recognize the power imbalance between being a representative of the Federal government and the people we serve.\n\nEngage with the broader community (other government agencies, nonprofits, grassroots organizations, or other groups working on a community level) to seek out knowledge and additional perspectives.\n\n{% include icons/favorite.svg %} Outside of your project work, make efforts to educate yourself, your team, and your leadership. Start up a book club and develop a reading list for people to read at their own pace.\n\n\n\n\n\n  {% include icons/edit.svg %} ACTIVITY\n  Conduct research as a team\n\n  As a team, divide up avenues to learn about the power structures, systems, and policymaking impacting the community for whom you’re designing.\n\n  Plan a time to discuss what you learned and which sources you found valuable.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine your biases in the context of the project\n\nDuring team formation, you should have spent time uncovering your biases and lived experiences. Take time to do the frames of reference activity again as a team, taking into consideration the context of the project you’re beginning. Couple the activity with a review of what you’ve learned about the audience for whom you’ll be designing.\n\nApply trauma-informed principles\n\nTrauma is an event, a series of events, or a set of circumstances experienced by an individual or group as emotionally or physically harmful, and that has lasting effects on their sense of well-being. The trauma-informed approach aims to avoid re-traumatization of a person during the course of your work.\n\nPeople are not defined by their demographics or behaviors alone. Consider what events and circumstances may be impacting someone, especially when you know you need to work with vulnerable individuals or communities.\n\n{% include icons/favorite.svg %} Ready to conduct research for your project? Learn how to recognize and respond to trauma during a research session.\n\nCreate a safe space for your team.\n\nIt is possible that you and your team may experience second-hand trauma during a project. Sometimes called vicarious trauma, it’s when people have prolonged exposure to victims of trauma or sensitive topics related to traumatic experiences. Learn about the signs for vicarious trauma and make space to talk about how the work may be affecting the team. If you see someone on your team exhibiting signs of vicarious trauma, there are several steps you can take.\n\n{% include icons/book.svg %} FURTHER READING\n\nMuch of this guidance regarding trauma is based off well-established research and resources from experts.

If presenting more than one table within a page, consider adding labels (e.g. “Table 1,” “Table 2,” etc.) in addition to titles. Labels should precede titles (e.g. “Table 1: The title given to this table”).\n\nLong column labels\n\nConsider using fixed columns or truncation for column labels that are significantly longer than the expected width of the data.\n\nUnit of measurement\n\nMake sure to indicate the unit of measurement. In terms of placement, if the units are the same across columns, indicate the unit of measurement in the title or someplace noticeable above the table.\n\nAlternatively, if the table uses at most two units of measurement, consider using asterisks following the column label, and define the unit of measurement below the table.\n\nIf units differ from column to column, the standard is to list the unit of measure in parentheses following the column label. Make sure to use common abbreviations when indicating units of measure. Spell out any ambiguous or obscure abbreviations.\n",

Be mindful of not getting too restrictive, however. This approach could work for phone numbers, but only if international numbers are not permitted.\n\nThese types of inputs should always be smaller widths:\n\n\n  Middle initial\n  Date, month, or year\n  State abbreviation\n\n\nContent guidelines\n\nText should be in sentence case.\n\nUse placeholder text for formatting examples only.

Text that is not readable turns off readers or makes it challenging for them to stay focused. The following guidelines promote good readability.\n\nAlignment\n\nTypography should be set flush left. This provides the eye a constant starting point for each line, making text easier to read.\n\n\n\nLine height\n\nAmple space between lines of type promotes an open feeling and lends flow to body copy. When setting body copy, the leading should be 1.375 times the type size, or 37.5% larger.\n\n\n\nLine length\n\nComfortable line length allows the reader’s eyes to flow easily from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. The ideal line length is 66 characters, including spaces, though lengths may range from 45 to 90 characters.\n\nIn digital materials, readers are afforded some level of control over line length by narrowing their browser window or changing the type size display on their devices. In printed materials, readers do not have this control. For this reason, special effort should be made to use a line length as close as possible to 66 characters in printed materials. This can be achieved by using a multi-column layout or larger margins.\n\n\n\nSpacing\n\nWhite space affects how the user focuses their attention on the content. It makes it easier to know what to read and where to begin. Spacing between typographic elements should be open enough to feel light, but close enough to establish a proper relationship between elements.\n\nHeading followed by body copy\n\nWhen a heading is followed by paragraph text, include 30px of space below Display and 15px below Headings 1–6.\n\n\n\nBody copy followed by a heading\n\nWhen body copy is followed by a heading, include 45px of space above Heading 2 and 30px above Headings 3–6.\n\n\n\nHeading followed by a heading\n\nFor stacked headings, include 30 px of space after the primary heading.\n\n\n\nBody copy spacing\n\nFor multiple paragraphs within the same section set the space between paragraphs to 15px.\n\n\n",

Follow the “Editing pages” steps above to edit and preview your new page.\n  If you’re unsure what sort of content you should add to a new Design System page, check out our sample component page. Click its “edit” button to view the sample content laid out in the CMS.\n  If you’d like your new page to appear in the side navigation, see below.\n\n\n\n      Create new page\n\n\nEditing the side navigation menu\n\n\n  To add new pages to the side navigation, or to rearrange the order of existing pages in the navigation, click the “Edit the side navigation” button below.\n  After logging into the CMS, navigation sections and their pages can be added, edited and removed. You’ll see a preview of the side navigation in the right-hand preview pane.\n\n\n\n      Edit the side navigation\n\n\nUploading images\n\nWhen editing a page, click the + icon to add an image. Select an image from the current library or upload a new image from your computer. Note: Due to a bug in Netlify CMS, the image might not immediately appear in the preview pane.\n\n\n",

It is a complex and multifaceted medium, requiring attention to every detail including story structure, composition, audio, color treatment, typography, timing, and more.\n\nAt the Bureau, we produce videos in a variety of styles and formats depending on the objective(s), targeted audience(s), scope, resources, content, and messaging for each project. We always strive to keep videos at the CFPB consistent and unique.\n\nWatch some of our public facing videos here.\n",

            'guidelines': "Preproduction\n\nEvery video project, no matter the size, requires forethought and planning. Preproduction is often considered the most important part of producing a video. This is where it all starts. During preproduction, we analyze the objectives and goals of a project, determine the audience, create concepts, develop a plan, determine the scope, and build a schedule for production and postproduction. At this stage, we determine the best way to present information to the intended audience and a realistic plan to achieve it.\n\nTone\n\nOne of the most important aspects of preproduction is establishing the tone. We prefer a natural, authentic tone, making sure to use imagery that does not feel staged or unrealistic, but rather true to the lives and situations of consumers. The tone should be welcoming, knowledgable, and authoritative without being demanding or overly complex.\n\nBudgeting\n\nProjects tend to vary in scope, and that will impact the budget. Budgeting takes place during preproduction and takes into account all expenses, personnel, and resources required to complete the project as planned. Therefore, it is essential stakeholders and decision-makers are transparent about their scope and needs so we can provide the best solution.\n\nScripting/treatments\n\nEvery video should have a script or creative treatment, even if there are no scenes or actors, to ensure everyone involved in creating the video knows the resources, concept, and overall plan being implemented. Scripts are usually written in a two column format, where audio appears in the left and visuals appear on the right.\n\n\n\n\n  Remember videos are a visual medium, so be sure to fill in enough visuals to appear on screen during the length of any narration.\n  Include descriptions of text, graphics, icons, or animations you’d like to appear on screen.\n  Keep your narration as short and easy-to-understand as possible. Try to avoid inaccessible technical or industry language and remember to keep your message focused and easy to understand. For complex topics, consider your audience and their needs.\n  Keep your scripts relatable and attempt to forge a human connection.\n  Avoid redundant or repeated information. Most videos should be short enough as to not require a summary of information already presented.\n  Strive to avoid clichés and imagine unique, relevant metaphors, dialogue, and images.\n  Keep the message simple. If you have several topics to cover, consider making several short videos rather than one long video.\n  Ensure your script’s length is accurate and sounds natural by reading the narration out loud at the intended pace. Reading silently is much faster, and thus can give inaccurate length estimates. Reading aloud also helps you review the flow and word choice of the script in a fresh way.\n\n\nLength\n\nThere are no specific length requirements for videos, but always try to make videos as short as possible. It’s important to keep the viewers’ attention. For most social media videos, try to stay under 3 minutes in length, but there’s no hard and fast rule for length.\n\nFilming\n\nWe strive to capture footage that feels modern, high-quality, and follows professional best practices. For example, we’re mindful of the rule of thirds, manual camera settings, properly exposing images, color balance, smooth camera movement, and how sound relates to the image.\n\n\n  Frame rates – We usually capture footage in 29.97fps or 23.97fps. If using slow motion, we will use a higher framerate, such as 60fps or 120fps (do NOT slow down footage in editing if it was not filmed that way, unless you’re trying to achieve a stylized look).\n  Exposure – All footage should be exposed properly, meaning the subject should stand out from the background, there are no over-exposed white or bright areas, or under-exposed black or dark areas (details can get lost in the shadows). Try to avoid the camera’s auto settings, as that will create exposure changes during the shot, and the footage will change colors and exposure throughout filming. This makes color correction, exposure compensation, and other problems difficult for the editor to fix.\n  White balance – This is also known as the color temperature. Ensure you set the correct white balance, so the image stays consistent and true to life. This is critical for skin tones to appear natural.\n  Focus/depth of field – The subject of each shot should be in focus. When filming people, focus on the eyes. Try to use selective focus and depth of field to create a variety of visuals. Typically, when filming a person, use a shallow depth of field (person in focus with a blurry background) to isolate them within the frame. They will stand out more to the viewer. Use a deep depth of field (everything is in focus) when establishing an environment or providing context as to how a subject relates to the background.\n  Camera movement – Moving the camera can draw viewers into the frame or serve a variety of artistic purposes, and typically elevates the overall quality of a video when done intentionally. Take opportunities to move the camera elegantly to visually tell a story or direct the viewer’s eyes. Ensure camera movement is smooth and not distracting. Filming in slow motion can help smooth out footage. In particular, when filming handheld, be sure footage does not shake or move too quickly unless you’re trying to achieve that specific look.\n  Zooming - Avoid zooming during a shot. Zooms are artificial and do not mimic the natural way we see the world, and therefore often degrade the quality of a given shot.\n  B-roll footage – Capture a wide variety of shots at every opportunity, even of the same scene or action. For each scene you should try to capture a variety of different focal lengths (close ups, medium, wide shots, etc.) and different camera angles. This makes your footage more interesting and provides options for your editor.\n  Establishing shots – When filming, always try to establish a scene or a sense of location by getting a wide shot of the environment first. This could be a room, building, or other image that provides context. Typically, an establishing shot or wide shot will begin and end a sequences of shots when editing.\n  Handheld footage – This allows a director of photography to capture a variety of shots quickly and follow the action. This is also known as ‘run and gun.’\n  Camera angles – Seek out visually interesting, well-composed camera angles. This not only provides interesting visuals, it allows for a sense of depth to the image, ensuring shots don’t feel flat.\n\n\nFraming\n\nAlways look at the whole frame. Try not to film a subject directly in the middle of a shot. Make sure to look at the top, bottom, left, right, and each corner of the frame when composing an image. Your goal should be to never crop the image in post. It should be framed correctly in camera. A video with perfect framing would mean each frame, if frozen, would appear as a well-composed photograph.\n\n\n\n  Term\n\n\n\n\n  Example\n\n\n\n\n\n  Symmetry Symmetrical shots can be used to effectively draw attention to the center of the screen, create a dramatic visual statement, or express an aesthetically pleasing balance. Symmetry gives an image more thematic and visual weight than shots around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  Rule of thirds  If one were to divide the screen evenly into thirds using horizontal and vertical lines, the focal point of the image would fall along the intersection of two of those lines. Visual lines, such as horizons or architectural columns, should fall along one of those lines. For most situations, adhering to the Rule of Thirds will help ensure proper composition, regardless of the subject matter.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  Extreme close-up (XCU)  A shot much closer than a typical CU, such as focusing closely on someone’s eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Close-up (CU)  A shot that is focused on one particular object filling most of the frame. For a person, a CU captures their head and shoulders.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Medium shot (MS)  A shot showing the subject and a moderate amount of background. For a person, it’s a shot framed from roughly the midsection up. This can also mean a shot from the thighs up (known as the “cowboy shot”).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Wide shot (WS)  A shot showing an entire object within the context of its environment or background. For a person, this is a head-to-toe shot.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Extreme wide shot (XWS)  Also known as a “landscape” shot, this is a very wide angle used to show off landscape, buildings, or large spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  Head room  This is the amount of room between the top of a subject and the top of the frame. When filming people, be aware of leaving too much head room—which will make the subject unnaturally small—and too little head room—making the subject’s head appear “stuck” to the top of the frame. In general, placing a subject’s eyes on the top third line ensures proper head room.\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n  Lead room  When an object or a subject is facing one side of the frame or another, there should be ample room in the negative space in front of that object, thus leading the viewer’s eyes in the correct direction. When in motion, the negative space should be where the object is headed, rather than where the object has been. * For example, if a person is looking to the right of frame, they should be placed on the left side of the frame looking towards the negative space. If a bicycle is rolling from left to right, the negative space should be on the right side of the frame so the bike can roll into that space.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  Framing note  Avoid framing people “at the joints”, such as knees, waist, and neck. Framing at the joints makes the subject look cut-off and unnatural.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLighting\n\nOur overall goal is to create natural-looking images with soft shadows, contrast, vibrant colors, and appropriately exposed subjects. Think of lighting as “painting the picture with shadows,” not just making things visible.\n\n\n  \n    Three-point lighting – Traditional three-point lighting includes the following: a key light, fill light, and back-light (opposite of the key light). We adjust our lighting setup according to the constraints of the location by adding lights to the background, balancing the exposure based on what we can’t control, using a wide range of modifiers, bouncing light, or taking lights away.\n\n    \n      Interviews - Three-Point Lighting is particularly useful for interview setups and testimonials.\n    \n  \n  Catch light – When lighting a person’s face, be sure the eyes are not shaded and strive to have a bit of light reflecting in the eyes. This is called a catch light or eye light. This technique will draw the viewer’s attention to the subject’s eyes. The catch light will make your subject look more intelligent, more alive, and more engaging. If the eyes are in shadow or under a hat, this may make the person look sinister or untrustworthy, so be sure a person’s eyes are well lit.\n  Light color/temperature – We ensure all lights are the appropriate color temperature and match the environmental color temperatures where needed. The most common color temperatures are measured by Kelvin (or a ‘K’ value). Daylight (cool/blue) is usually 5600k and tungsten (warm/orange) is usually 3200k. If you don’t know the exact color temperature or don’t have access to a professional color meter, most cameras can capture a relatively accurate reading of the color temperature by using a white card.\n  Soft lighting – Strive to make the shadows soft, giving shape and definition to your subject without casting harsh shadows. To do this, diffuse light using soft boxes, silks, or bouncing the light off a large white surface like a ceiling or wall.\n  Outdoor lighting – We apply the same visual standards to outdoor footage and lighting as we do indoors. When filming outdoors, avoid direct sunlight, harsh shadows, and sunny, over-exposed backgrounds. Try shooting in the shade. Also, remember to shoot into the shadows to create an interesting shot. The sun can create an edge around the subject. This will add depth to an image. Choose angles, locations, time of day, and subject positions that provide enough light on both subject and background. Sometimes this can be tricky when working with time constraints. If shooting a person during a sunny day without shade, try using a silk or other diffusion to soften shadows and make the image look more appealing. If possible, try using lights outside that are bright enough to supplement the sun.\n  Practical lighting – Very often, an environment will already feature practical lights such as interior lighting in office buildings or stores. If you cannot turn the practical lights off, you can use them to assist in lighting. Adding lamps, lanterns, or other lights to the background or environment of a shot can give it an extra sense of realness. We also use practical lights to “motivate” the lighting setup of production lights. When using practical lights, be aware of any flickering, rolling, or stuttering they may cause in the camera. This can sometimes be addressed by adjusting the shutter speed, and sometimes the only solution is to turn the lights off. Otherwise, rolling or flickering may ruin any footage captured. Always be aware of the color temperature of practical lights and ensure skin tones look natural. Avoid florescent lights that give the image a green or magenta color tone.\n  No lighting – In circumstances when you don’t have professional lighting available, ensure there is more light on your subject than on the background, and try to use soft natural sources to achieve proper exposure. Avoid pointing the camera at large windows or bright spots directly in the background. Instead, use the light from that window to illuminate your subject. Using the environment is vital, and a combination of environmental and practical lights can create a natural, realistic image that is pleasing to the viewer.\n\n\nInterview framing\n\nOur on-camera interviews feature realistic but aesthetically pleasing backgrounds, need to be well-lit, and framed in such a way as to look trustworthy, professional, and with realistic contrast and exposure.\n\n\n  Subjects either look off-camera or directly to camera depending on the message of the video. Looking off-camera feels natural and trustworthy. Looking directly to camera is for personal, direct messages.\n  Pay attention to the eye line. The interviewer should be placed at eye-level with the subject.\n  Have as much separation between subject and background as possible, and avoid flat walls, over-exposed windows or doorways, or distracting motion in the background. Often the corner of a room is the most interesting background in a plain setting.\n  Search for interesting backgrounds. Avoid flat, featureless backgrounds. Try to frame interesting lines and angles in the background. Subtle touches of art or objects—such as a plant, award, or bookshelf—and textures or design elements of architecture go a long way.\n  Beware of objects behind the subject’s head, such as lamps, door frames, or poles. This may make the subject appear to have an object attached to or sticking out of their head.\n\n\nTwo-camera interviews\n\nWhen filming with two cameras, the color balance, frame rate, resolution, camera settings, and exposure should match exactly between cameras.\n\n\n  The cameras need to have different focal lengths to allow for easy, seamless edits. For example, if Camera 1 is a close-up, Camera 2 should be a wide shot.\n  Cameras should be placed on the same side of the subject and should not “jump the 180 line.” For example, if the subject is on the left side of the screen facing right in Camera 1, they should be on the left side of the screen facing right in Camera 2 as well.\n\n\nInterview questions\n\nWhen asking questions for an on-camera interview, always aim to capture the personality and humanity of the interview subject, rather than news-like sound bites.\n\n\n  Try to avoid sharing questions with interviewees in advance. The natural instinct for most people is to memorize responses. This will result in an unnatural interview. If the interviewee needs to be prepped for some reason, provide a bulleted list of general topics or talking points. This will allow them to gather their thoughts or get the facts straight in advance.\n  Make sure your interviewee provides a slate on camera—while recording, the first thing they should say on camera is their name spelled out, their title, and any other relevant “introductory” information. The producer and editor will reference this when organizing the video project.\n  Try to establish a trusting rapport with the interviewee, keeping the interview conversational in nature and encouraging honest answers.\n  Encourage interviewees to speak in complete sentences, sometimes repeating parts of the question in their answer or providing context. Ask yourself— Will this response make sense if the viewer doesn’t hear the question?\n  Avoid asking “yes or no” questions or questions with one-word answers. Delve deeper into topics by asking “how” and “why.”\n  Ask follow-up questions and feel free to go off script to keep the conversation flowing naturally.\n  Ask questions that can be answered by expressing feelings and impressions, rather than simple facts. Get to the human element. For example, asking why a person is proud of an accomplishment or what the most challenging part of a project was, or how a certain action made them feel.\n  If an interviewee is talking about numbers, data, or complex topics, encourage them to put their answers in a context the audience will easily understand.\n  In most cases, encourage answers that avoid technical jargon or insider language (unless that’s the audience you’re speaking to).\n  Ensure interviewees avoid self-editing, cutting themselves off, or making faces while delivering a line. Assure interviewees that even if one portion of their answer is wrong, they should complete their thought because you will be able to edit later.\n  Try to encourage succinct, short, complete answers to questions rather than long stories.\n  Do not talk over your interviewee or “step on their line.” Also, make sure they don’t talk over you. Try to give at least a second or two pause between questions and responses. This may feel unnatural, but the editor will thank you.\n  Use silence to your advantage. Interviewees tend to want to fill that silence by adding additional information. If the interviewee pauses or if there’s a hesitation, let their response play out and listen.\n\n\niPhone self-filming\n\nWe often use iPhones for self-filmed testimonials or other information in order to respond quickly.\n\n\n  Hold phone horizontal or vertical using a stand, clip, or other mounting solution to keep the phone in position without shaking or moving.\n  Have subjects center themselves in the frame, facing a soft light source such as a window or light-colored wall. It is important to have even lighting on the subject’s face, and for the face to have more light than the background.\n  Ensure the camera phone is eye-level with the subject, approximately an arm’s length away from the subject (usually a standard focal length), and with approximately four finger’s worth of headroom.\n  Try to create distance between the subject and the background. Stay far enough away from walls or backgrounds so as to not cast a shadow.\n  Make sure the subject’s location is quiet and use a lavalier or directional microphone if possible. Avoid covering the microphone and try to eliminate or minimize any background noises such as air conditioners, barking dogs, or traffic.\n  Find a visually pleasing background, like a wall, room, or other surface that is clear of artwork or other personal items. Avoid backgrounds that are busy, cluttered, or overly bright.\n  Strive to find a background that visually represents the message and tone you’re trying to communicate.\n  Have subjects smile and deliver information with an optimistic tone, sit with proper posture, and remember to look at the camera lens, not their own image on the screen.\n  Subjects should remember to provide “handles” by leaving 5 seconds of recording before they begin speaking and 5 seconds after they complete the take.\n\n\nWardrobe\n\nActors or interview subjects appearing on camera should wear appropriate, non-distracting clothing that lends itself to the overall aesthetic of the video. Usually, our talent will wear business casual, solid colors or appealing patterns. Tattoos may need to be covered with clothing, depending on the message and topic of the video.\n\n\n  Things to avoid – logos or clothing brands, neon colors, solid white or black clothing, busy or tight patterns, or clothing with distracting or inappropriate text or images.\n\n\nHair and makeup\n\nActors or interview subjects appearing on camera should appear natural, well-kempt, and representative of the video. Hair should be clean and styled in a way that would be appropriate for a business interaction. Makeup should be minimal, aimed mainly at reducing shine, blotting perspiration, or subtly highlighting features like the eyes.\n\nAudio\n\nHigh-quality audio is incredibly important. We always emphasize recording and delivering the clearest, sharpest audio possible.\n\n\n  When recording an interview or other on-camera talent, try to hide all microphones. This can mean hiding a lavalier mic out of frame, under a collar, within an open jacket, or even in a subject’s hair. But remember—clean audio is the most important thing. We will show a lavalier mic if it means better quality audio. Otherwise, we’ll just use the audio from a professional shotgun/boom that’s slightly out of frame, instead.\n  If recording with a shotgun microphone, the best-sounding audio typically comes from aiming the microphone at the subject’s throat or right above the chest. Try angling the mic from above and slightly at an angle.\n  Audio should adhere to broadcast standards, averaging around -12dB with peaking not to rise above -6dB.\n  Use a windscreen if shooting outside or at a location with a breeze.\n  Avoid ambient noise, electronic interference, or recording audio in locations that have echoes or distracting background noises.\n  When filming b-roll, always try to record audio too. These natural sounds or sound effects provide the editor with more elements to make the video more engaging.\n\n\nVoice over talent\n\nEnsure clear, professional, well-spoken narration and voice over recordings.\n\n\n  Use professional Voice Over Talent (VO) whenever possible. A coworker with a “good voice” does not necessarily have the professional training, talent, and experience to recite narration. Instead, search for professional voice actors with samples from previous work when selecting VO talent.\n  VO recordings should be within broadcast standards, crisp and clear with no background noise or microphone pops, and it should be de-breathed.\n  If you must use non-professional Voice Over Talent, be sure to record in conditions as close to a recording studio as possible. This means finding a quiet, padded or carpeted area where there will be no echoes, electric noise, or distracting background noises. In some cases, recording underneath a blanket or in a closet may give the best results.\n\n\nEditing guidelines\n\nEditing is key. It’s essential to visual storytelling and marries the artistic language of film to the technical considerations. Our projects are edited not simply to repeat information, but with an eye for messaging, presentation, style and technique. Edits should be dynamic and intentional.\n\n\n  Ensure sequence settings are consistent with the footage and needs of the project. The CFPB typically shoots, edits, and creates sequences in 1920 x 1080 (or 3840 x 2160 if 4K), 29.97fps or 23.98fps.\n  Videos should not be distorted (stretched or squeezed) in post-production or exporting and should conform to a 16x9 aspect ratio. Some 4K footage is not recorded at 16x9 and will cause letterboxes if not corrected in post.\n  All cuts should be relevant, motivated, or in time with music or narration. Whenever possible, cut on the action. Each edit or transition needs a reason.\n  Choose a variety of focal lengths, angles, focal distances, and framing. For example, do not use three medium shots in a row. This variation keeps the editing dynamic and visually interesting.\n  Avoid using shaky shots, improperly exposed footage, blurry or out-of-focus images, and jump cuts.\n  Either cut to the content or music (or both, for a dynamic edit). When cutting to the music, look for other visual motivations for cutting in addition to musical notes, thus varying the shot length and rhythm of the edit. Not every cut needs to be on the beat.\n  Sequences or segments should tell a story. This is typically done by starting with a wide establishing shot, and each subsequent cut using a shot with a different focal length or action. Sequences typically start and end on wide shots, with the more detailed, closer shots in the middle.\n  When converting footage to slow motion, do not slow down footage that was captured in 23.97fps or 29.97fps. Instead, convert high framerate footage (such as 60fps or 120fps) into the timeline’s frame rate.\n\n\nLogo usage\n\nThe CFPB adheres to our brand standards for logo usage. Within any given video, we use an animated version of our logo. This logo always appears over white and is always the same logo animation, whether used for the intro, title, outro, or within the video itself.\n\n\n\nWatermark\n\nOur logo appears as a watermark in the upper left-hand corner of any social media videos we produce.\n\n\n\nMotion graphics\n\nWe often feature motion graphics in our videos, whether full-screen or superimposed over footage. Please refer to our Motion Graphics page for specific motion graphics guidance.\n\nMusic\n\nMusic is an incredibly important aspect of any video, helping to guide and highlight the mood of the piece, set the tone, and draw the viewer’s attention. When selecting music, ensure it is high-quality and cinematic, matching and underscoring the messages and themes of the piece you are editing.\n\n\n  We strive to use music often, although sometimes a lack of music is more effective.\n  Be sure music begins and ends on smooth notes. In other words, do not start or end a music track abruptly or without context, but rather find a musical transition, change in tone, or the ending of a measure or segment. This includes fading up and fading down during musical changes.\n  Music should be edited to fit the length of the video or portion of the video where it is relevant.\n\n\nSound design\n\nSound design is another element we use to elevate our work and accentuate our storytelling.\n\n\n  Use sound effects and “nat pops,” or natural sound pops, throughout a video to create a sense of realness, motion, and sometimes to draw the viewer’s attention to certain elements. These sound elements apply to motion graphics and animation as well as video footage.\n\n\nExporting formats\n\nIf exporting finished video, the export format depends on where the video will be shown or hosted. For most uses, we export a ProRes HQ file and an H.264 mp4 file for social media use.\n",

            'accessibility': "Include text alternatives for non-text content.\n\nFor any content that is not text-based (images, audio, video, animations, charts, graphs, etc), provide an alternative version of that content that is text-based.\n\n\n  Provide transcripts of audio and video recordings.\n\n\nProvide alternatives for multimedia.\n\nMultimedia such as audio, video, and animations will usually require more than just descriptive text. In most cases, the timing of text and descriptions in these files is important and should therefore be incorporated in an accessible manner.\n\nPrerecorded content\n\n\n  For audio-only content, provide a transcript of both spoken words and descriptions of other sounds.\n  For video-only content, provide an audio track or transcript that describes the video.\n  Combined audio and video content should accommodate alternatives for both (e.g., closed captioning or sign interpretation for audio, and an audio track or a screenplay-like document that transcribes dialog and descriptions of sounds and action for video).\n\n\nCreate open caption and closed caption files.\n\nFor any content that has spoken audio, we provide captions for accessibility. The choice between open caption and close caption depends on the platform through which we will be showing the video and the particulars of the project.\n\n\n  For open caption files, we strive to make the text easy to read, clear, and within our brand standards by using our fonts, weights, and colors.\n  For open captions we can also use the on-screen text as a design element, and may use colors or background shapes to highlight important messages.\n  For open captions, if the video will be too bright or otherwise make text difficult to read, we use a rounded rectangle at 50% opacity beneath the captions in order to make it most legible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  For closed caption files, unfortunately you are unable to change the font, weight, size, color, etc.\n  For closed caption files, it is our best practice to upload an accurate version of the transcript instead of using auto-generated transcripts.\n\n\nLive content\n\n\n  Closed captioning or sign language interpretation should always be available, but in some cases providing the prepared remarks or script alongside the audio/video may suffice.\n\n\nMake content easily distinguishable from its surroundings.\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that content is perceivable for sighted users.\n\nAudio\n\n\n  Avoid auto-playing audio. If this is absolutely unavoidable, provide a control that allows the user to stop the audio and adjust or mute the volume.\n  In recorded audio, background sounds should be at least 20 dB lower than foreground sounds and speech. This does not apply to music.\n\n\nDo not create designs or interactions that may cause seizures.\n\n\n  Nothing on the page should flash more than 3 times in 1 second.\n\n",
